<h1>Coloring Graph</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is trying to solve the famous NP complete coloring graph problem, where the goal is to try to find the least amount of number of colors to color an indirected graph. This program is running through a greedy approach
<br />
<h2> Algorithmn </h2>
1. Color first vertex with first color. 
<br/>
2. Do following for remaining V-1 vertices. 
<br/>
  - Consider the currently picked vertex and color it with the 
lowest numbered color that has not been used on any previously 
colored vertices adjacent to it. If all previously used colors 
appear on vertices adjacent to v, assign a new color to it.
